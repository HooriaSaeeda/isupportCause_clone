## Overview

This project is a practice clone of the iSupportCause Profile Picture Campaign. It was one of my first practice projects designed for desktop only, with no responsive features. The purpose was to replicate the core structure and functionality of a platform that promotes social causes by allowing users to support campaigns through profile picture frames.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the page.
- JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- Google Fonts (Roboto): For clean and modern typography.
- FontAwesome Icons: Easy-to-use icons to enhance UI/UX.
- Flexbox & Grid: For structured layouts.

**Note: This project is designed specifically for desktop screens and is not responsive.**

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:
- Implementing an image slider with JavaScript
- Working with CSS for responsive design
- Using `@media` queries to hide elements on smaller screens
- Structuring and organizing an HTML form with flexbox

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Build fully responsive designs that work across devices.
- Add more interactivity through advanced JavaScript.
- Explore backend integration to create more dynamic web applications.
